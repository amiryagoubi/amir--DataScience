    "> when it comes to adding more content into your jupyter notebook, you could consider the following tips \n",
    "1. **Continue Adding Markdown and Code Cells:**  \n",
    ". **Markdown Cells:** Use these for titles, descriptions, notes, or any non-code content. You can add more structure with different levels of headings or even lists and links.  \n",
    ". **Code Cells:** These should contain executable code snippets and their outputs. This is where you can showcase coding tips and examples.\n",
    "2. **Formatting Markdwon Cells:**  \n",
    "You can enhance your Markdown cells with various formatting options like:  \n",
    ". Bold (\\*\\*text\\*\\*\\), Italics (\\*text\\*), or Strikethrough (\\~\\~text\\~\\~).  \n",
    ". Creating lists, either ordered (1. item) or unordered (\\- item).  \n",
    ". Adding links (\\[link text\\](URL)) and images (\\!\\[alt text\\](image URL)).\n",
    "3. **Executing Code Cells:**  \n",
    "When you add a code cell with Python code or any other supported language, execute it to see the results directly below the cell. This is especially useful for demonstrating examples or data visualizations with libraries like matplotlib or pandas.\n",
    "4. **Adding More Cells:**  \n",
    "You can add new cells at any point by selecting an existing cell and using the + button at the top of the notebook to add a cell below it. Alternatively, use the shortcuts A (insert cell above) or B (insert cell below) while in command mode (press Esc to enter command mode).\n"
